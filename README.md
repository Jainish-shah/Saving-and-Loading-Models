Saving a model in machine learning is one of the advantage that one can have.Benefits for saving a model are:
- This models can be shared with others
- One can improve the model with new data by resuming right where one has left.

A saved model contains all the information about the model including the weights values of the model, architecture of the model and even model optimizers configuration.

So the saved models makers our work easy, as we can directy execute the model( without training) to our application (Tensorflow Serving, Tensorflow Lite, Tensorflow.js)
